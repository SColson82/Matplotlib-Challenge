# Matplotlib-Challenge
* In this challenge, a set of data for a trial of cancer drug treatments was given to be cleaned and examined and reported in a manner which can be more quickly and easily referenced and interpretted.
 
## Observations and Insights
### (These may additionally be viewed at the beginning of the challenge submission as requested in the instructions.)
* I assume that dropping the mouse that has duplicated timepoints is a 'bandaid measure' rather than the standard practice as I would think that we would first go back to the source and try to figure out if it is all bad or if only a portion is bad or perhaps if that was a clerkical error in the data entry. For example, if the wrong mouse number was applied to one set of data this can be quickly corrected. I suspect that the removed data should have belonged to 2 female mice in the trials for Zoniferol and Propriva, (however if I were presenting this data I might make a note of it but I would not make that assumption as a professional). Going back to the technicians who collected the data might solve the problem.
* This trial appears to be fairly evenly distributed with approximately 25 mice in each of drug trials and a placebo group set up as a control. Approximately 50% each of male and female are represented.
* There appears to be a high correlation between weight and final tumor volume. However, I would reassert that correlation does not indicate causality.
* Based on the final tumor volume box plots, the most promising of the four requested drug treatments appears to be Capomulin and Ramicane.
* I would suggest a reevaluation of the data for the outlier on Infubinol. Was there an error in the data collection or was there potentially some other variable introduced which might cause the Infubinol treatment to be examined under new light?
* Two other considerations that I might would explore further is the final tumor volume for each treatment per gender and then also the mortality rate per drug trial (under the assumption that the timepoints collected that were less than 45 days (the mode of the Timepoint data) would indicate the test mouse did not survive to the end of the trial).
